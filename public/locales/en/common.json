          "answer": "Just drag files into the conversion area on the homepage and click Convert. It's a browser-based, no-install conversion. When it's done, you can download a ZIP in one click or save files one by one. Your photos are never sent to a server."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I batch convert HEIC files on iPhone?",
          "answer": "Yes. You can convert multiple files at once (batch). It works in browsers on iOS/Android phones and tablets, as well as Mac/Windows. For smoother performance, we recommend keeping each batch under 200 photos; if you have a lot of photos on iPhone, split them into smaller batches."

        {
          "question": "Do you support HEIF? What's the difference between JPG and JPEG?",
          "answer": "Yes, HEIF/HEIC are supported. JPG and JPEG are the same format: JPEG is the official name, while JPG is the common file extension. You can also use it for HEIC to JPEG conversions."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I convert HEIC to JPEG on iPhone?",

          "question": "Is it safe to convert HEIC to JPG online?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Are there limits on usage or number of files?",
          "answer": "It's completely free, with no strict limits on usage or file count. The practical limit depends on your device; we recommend up to 200 photos per batch, under 30MB per file, and under 1GB total to avoid memory slowdowns."
        },
        {
          "question": "Will HEIC to JPG reduce image quality? Is EXIF preserved?",
          "answer": "Quality loss is usually minimal and hard to notice. We preserve EXIF when possible, but browser-based conversion can't guarantee 100% retention."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the easiest way to do a HEIC JPG conversion on Windows 10/11?",
